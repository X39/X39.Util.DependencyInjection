# X39.Util.DependencyInjection
`X39.Util.DependencyInjection` hosted in the `cs-x39-util-dependencyinjection` repository, is my personal utility library,
containing commonly used methods and classes regarding dotnet dependency injection.

# Licence
The whole project is released to the public under the `LGPLv3` licence.
The reasoning for this is to "force" anyone using this to disclose changes to the
repository, allowing fixes to be merged upstream (aka: into this repository).
